      "sentComment": "An anonymous reader writes A Turkish hacking ring has broken into 2 sensitive US Army servers according to a new investigation uncovered by InformationWeek.The hackers who go by the name m0sted and are based in Turkey penetrated servers at the Armys McAlester Ammunition Plant in Oklahoma in January. Users attempting to access the site were redirected to a page featuring a climatechange protest. In Sept 2007 the hackers breached Army Corps of Engineers servers. That hack sent users to a page containing antiAmerican and antiIsraeli rhetoric. The hackers used simple SQL Server injection techniques to gain access.Thats troubling because it shows a major Army security lapse and also the ability to bypass supposedly sophisticated Defense Department tools and procedures designed to prevent such breaches."

It made Vietnam very difficult and it has made Iraq difficult as well.What we have is a guerrilla war against hackers where they are effectiely shielded in most cases by the ISP and their own countrys law enforcement. The end result is almost an unwinnable war.We are winning in Iraq by ending the use of civilians as shields. We won in Vietnam by separating the combatants from the civilians. It is going to take that sort of effort to win against hackers crackers and identity thieves. Unfortunately right now the effort required to do this is intense enough that it is many many times the losses so far. So I dont think they are going to do anything until the losses mount up a lot more.What makes this worse is in order to effectively combat these people it is going to take either the cooperation of foreign law enforcement or just going around them. Neither one is going to make these other countries want to be our friends but they seem to be happy with the hackers running around doing whatever.",

One such idiot full of cyberhype recently showed he knew less about Trojans than anyone with even a passing knowlege of european culture let alone a computer professional ie. the Trojan horse lets the other nasty stuff in. Forget the guerrilla war against hackers bullshit since the people we really want to catch are fraudsters money launderers and the occassional trespasser onto military networks which makes them a spy and not some cyberterrorist. When we escalate the words into the realm of fantasy you end up with pointless running around in circles trying to catch fantastic supervillians that may not exist instead of looking at reality and catching those that do exist.",
